# IS2101 - Arithmetic Operations in C

This project contains three C programs that implement fundamental binary arithmetic algorithms: **Sequential Multiplication**, **Restoring Division**, and **Non-Restoring Division**. Each program demonstrates the step-by-step process of these operations, providing a clear visual representation of how they work at a low level.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation & Execution

To compile and run the programs, you'll need a C compiler like GCC. You can use the following commands in your terminal.

### 1\. Sequential Multiplication

  * **Compile:** `gcc a_Sequential_Multiplication.c -o a_Sequential_Multiplication.exe`
  * **Execute:** `.\a_Sequential_Multiplication.exe`

### 2\. Restoring Division

  * **Compile:** `gcc b_Restoring_Division.c -o b_Restoring_Division.exe`
  * **Execute:** `.\b_Restoring_Division.exe`

### 3\. Non-Restoring Division

  * **Compile:** `gcc c_NonRestoring_Division.c -o c_NonRestoring_Division.exe`
  * **Execute:** `.\c_NonRestoring_Division.exe`

## üì• Inputs & üì§ Outputs

Each program requires specific inputs and produces a detailed output of the operation.

### 1\. Sequential Multiplication

  * **Inputs:** Multiplicand, Multiplier, and Bit-size.
  * **Outputs:** A step-by-step breakdown of the shift/add operations and the final product.
  * **Example Output:** A console screenshot showing the step-by-step process of multiplying two numbers, with columns for the Multiplicand, Multiplier, and the Accumulator, and a final calculated product.

### 2\. Restoring Division

  * **Inputs:** Dividend and Divisor.
  * **Outputs:** A detailed, step-by-step log of the restoring division process, along with the final quotient and remainder.
  * **Example Output:** A console screenshot displaying the iterative process of restoring division, with steps showing left shifts, subtractions, and the restoration of the accumulator when the result is negative.

### 3\. Non-Restoring Division

  * **Inputs:** Dividend and Divisor.
  * **Outputs:** A detailed, step-by-step log of the non-restoring division process, along with the final quotient and remainder.
  * **Example Output:** A console screenshot illustrating the non-restoring division algorithm, highlighting the different operations (subtraction or addition) based on the sign of the accumulator.

## ‚úÖ Sample Results

Here are some sample results from running the programs with specific inputs:

  * **Non-Restoring Division:** `13 √∑ 3` results in a Quotient of `4` and a Remainder of `1`.
  * **Restoring Division:** `73 √∑ 4` results in a Quotient of `18` and a Remainder of `1`.
  * **Sequential Multiplication:** `12 √ó 2` results in a Product of `24`.
